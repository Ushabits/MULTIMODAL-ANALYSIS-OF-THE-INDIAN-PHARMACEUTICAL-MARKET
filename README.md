**Multimodal Analysis of the Indian Pharmaceutical Market**

📌 **Project Overview**

We built three deep-learning models to analyse different aspects of the Indian pharmaceutical ecosystem:

1. Therapeutic Class Identification
Classifies medicines into therapeutic categories using raw text fields.

2. Drug Discontinuation Prediction
Predicts whether a drug is likely to be discontinued using multimodal inputs.

3. Price Prediction & Pricing-Tier Classification
A two-tower multi-task model that predicts both exact drug prices and their pricing tier.  

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

🚀 **How to Run**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

pip install -r requirements.txt

📌 **Notes**
The original dataset cannot be uploaded due to size/sensitivity restrictions.
All code is organised to run with any dataset matching the same schema.
The project report includes analysis, results, and insights generated from these models.
